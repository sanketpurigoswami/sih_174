# MHR-ONLY distillation — no concurrent 3D coordinate head.
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# SAM3D-Body (the teacher) has NO 3D and NO 2D pose head.  Its only
# predictive modules are head_pose.proj (519 outputs = MHR params) and
# head_camera.proj (3 outputs = s, tx, ty).  The 70 keypoints are
# obtained as  keypoint_mapping @ [verts ; joints]  AFTER the MHR
# forward, and the 2D ones by perspective re-projection of those 3D
# points.  Everything is derived from the mesh.
#
# The student mirrors that: the 3D head is GONE and every 3D quantity
# is derived from the MHR forward pass.  Concretely
#
#   mhr_params, shape_params ──► MHR skeleton (127 joints)
#                            ──► W @ joints  = 70 native keypoints
#
# where W is a (70, 127) affine regressor fitted offline against the
# teacher's own labels (see fit_keypoint_regressor / --fit-regressor).
# Held-out residual of that fit: 1.36 mm mean / 0.005 mm median, which
# is two orders of magnitude below the target PA-MPJPE.  Because W's
# rows sum to exactly 1 it commutes with rigid transforms, so the
# augmentation counter-rotations keep working unchanged.
#
# The 2D SimCC head is KEPT.  It is training-only (deployment re-projects
# the MHR keypoints) but it is the only supervision that survives a
# horizontal flip un-masked, so removing it would starve the flipped
# half of the augmented samples.
#
# EXPORT CONTRACT CHANGED: the ONNX now has FOUR outputs
#   (mhr_params, shape_params, cam_trans, joints_2d)
# instead of five — joints_3d is gone.  instanthmr/inference.py must be
# patched before this model can be used there; see the note on
# HMRDeployWrapper below.

    """SAM 3D Body's continuous pose head, emitting the rig-native 204-vector.

    447 numbers come out of a two-layer MLP and are converted here, so the rest
    of the model, every loss, the ONNX graph and `instanthmr.inference` all keep
    the contract they already have: 204 MHR parameters and 45 identity
    coefficients. (The teacher emits 519; the extra 72 are a face block its own
    `forward()` multiplies by zero.)

        6    root rotation, 6D            -> 3 extrinsic-XYZ Euler angles
        260  body pose, continuous        -> 130 angles
        45   identity                     -> passed through
        28   bone-scale PCA coefficients  -> 68 bone scales
        108  two 54-dim hand blocks       -> overwrite the 54 finger channels

    Three things are deliberate and each is measured in the file that owns it:

    * **Root translation is emitted as exact zero**, not regressed. It is
      `0.000e+00` in all 24,000 sampled annotations -- the person is placed by
      `cam_trans` -- and the teacher's head does the same (`global_trans =
      torch.zeros_like(...)`).

    * **The bone-scale bound is on the 28 coefficients, not the 68 scales.**
      Clamping after the PCA expansion is what `--bound-scales` does and it is
      wrong here: an arbitrary point of the 68-dim box is generally not in the
      24-dimensional column space `scale_comps` spans, so a coordinatewise tanh
      silently leaves the subspace. The coefficient limits come from the corpus
      (`tools/build_cont_head_assets.py`; GT projection residual 2.1e-08).

    * **The six `*_length/_width_flexible` channels at `130:136` are bounded
      separately.** The continuous body space carries them raw -- they are
      joint TRANSLATION channels, not rotations -- so they are exactly as
      unbounded here as they were before, and they reach 375 m on their own.

    Assembly is one `index_select` over a fixed 136-long gather table rather
    than three masked writes: `x[..., idx] = v` traces to a scatter, a gather
    exports everywhere and is its own documentation.

    Applying a single weight_decay to `model.parameters()` penalises every

        BN gamma toward 0 shrinks the layer's output scale, which the following
        layer has to keep re-learning.
      * **biases** — a bias is an offset, not a capacity knob; decay just
        re-centres it toward 0 for no regularisation benefit.
      * **depthwise convolution kernels** — a depthwise filter has only
        k*k weights per channel (9 for 3x3) instead of C_in*k*k, so an L2
        penalty of the same magnitude is a far larger *relative* pull on it.
        MobileNet-family backbones are mostly depthwise, so uniform wd hits
        them much harder than it hits a conventional/hybrid backbone.

    This is a general recipe fix, not a MobileNet-specific hack -- the same
    exclusions are standard for RepViT too (both are BN-heavy and RepViT's
    token mixer is itself depthwise). Use it for every backbone or none, or

    """FOUR outputs: (mhr_params, shape_params, cam_trans, joints_2d).

    BREAKING CHANGE vs train_distill_optimized_correctives.py, which exported a
    fifth tensor `joints_3d` straight from the (now deleted) 3D head.

    The MHR skeleton block cannot be folded into the ONNX graph: the TorchScript
    artefact exposes `character_torch` as a `pymomentum...Character` object, not
    an `nn.Module`, and torch.onnx.export refuses to trace through it
    ("Tried to trace <...Character> but it is not part of the active trace").
    So the 3D keypoints have to be produced by the consumer.

    Required patch in instanthmr/inference.py (NOT applied here — it would add a
    hard torch/mhr dependency to a module that is currently numpy + onnxruntime
    only, which is not a risk-free change to make blind):

      * __init__ (~l.119): the comment "Output order from export: ...,
        joints_3d" is now wrong; assert len(out_names) == 4 and load the MHR
        TorchScript model + instanthmr_distill_train/assets/mhr_j127_to_kp70.npy.
      * predict (~l.157-162): `joints_3d_local = outs[4][0]` must become

            joints_3d_local = self._mhr_keypoints(mhr_params[None])[0]

        where `_mhr_keypoints` is MHRForwardPass.get_native_keypoints from this
        file (skeleton forward -> /100 -> negate Y,Z -> W @ joints).
      * predict_batch (~l.239): same for `joints_3d_local_b = outs[4]`, batched.
      * The docstrings of `InstantHMR` and `HMRPrediction` that advertise a
        70x3 joints_3d output straight from the ONNX session.

    Measured cost of that extra forward: ~0.6 ms at batch 1 and ~0.7 ms at
    batch 8 on an RTX 4070 (no_grad, skeleton branch only, no skinning).

    """Least-squares fit of the (70, 127) skeleton -> native-keypoint map.

    The fit is parametrised so that every row of W sums to EXACTLY 1: instead of
    regressing the keypoint on the raw joints, we regress (kp - J_ref) on
    (J_j - J_ref) and recover w_ref = 1 - sum(other weights).  An affine
    combination commutes with any rigid transform, which is what makes the
    augmentation counter-rotations valid on the regressed keypoints.

    The design matrix is rank-deficient (rank 116 of 127 — some MHR joints are
    exact linear combinations of others), so the pseudo-inverse is truncated at
    `rcond` instead of solved directly; the default keeps rank 73 and bounds
    |W| at ~4, which is the knee of the accuracy / conditioning trade-off.
