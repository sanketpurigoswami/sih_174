"""3DPW as a held-out validation set during training.

The default validation set is a random slice of the training corpus, which
measures agreement with the teacher on data drawn from the same distribution —
useful as a training-health signal, useless as a measure of generalisation.
3DPW is real MoCap ground truth from a different distribution, so it answers a
different and more interesting question.

Two rules that matter more than the code:

**Use the ``validation`` split (12 sequences), not ``test``.** The 24 test
sequences are what ``benchmark/eval_3dpw.py`` reports for publication. Select a
checkpoint on them and that number stops being held-out — it becomes a number
you optimised against. The validation split exists precisely so you don't have
to spend the test split on model selection.

**Never build ``3dpw_train`` into the training corpus.** Neighbouring frames of
the same person in the same scene make frame-level holdout meaningless. This is
already the situation locally, where ``sam3d_distill_mix`` contains crops from
all 60 sequences (see ``benchmark/README.md``). On Jean Zay it is not: the built
corpus is coco/mpii/aic/sa1b only, so 3DPW there is genuinely unseen — which is
what makes this worth doing on the cluster and not on the laptop.

GT is the published protocol by default — SMPL forward + the H36M regressor,
precomputed by ``benchmark/make_3dpw_gt.py`` into ``<3DPW root>/gt_h36m/`` and
rsynced next to ``sequenceFiles``. ``gt="jointpositions"`` restores the raw
pickle field the harness used before; the two are several mm apart, so numbers
from the two sources must never be compared to each other.

Selection metric is **J14 PA-MPJPE with the MHR70 -> J14 adapter applied** —
the same quantity `benchmark/eval_3dpw_ckpt.py` reports and a paper quotes, so
the training log, the run summary and the results table all carry one number.
The adapter (`benchmark/results/adapter_j14_h36m_teacher.npz`) is a fixed 14x70
map fitted from the teacher's MHR labels, independent of any student, so it
does not move between checkpoints or between runs.
