"""Batched InstantHMR inference over a flat list of (image, bbox) samples.

The public API is :func:`run_samples`. It groups samples by source image so
each frame is decoded once and all its people go through the ONNX graph in a
single call, and it overlaps JPEG decoding with GPU work via a small prefetch
pool. Predictions come back in the input order.
